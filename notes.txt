Could add points for when you complete task.
Then there should be separate remove buttons too.

Items will probably need some sort of code to store their values.
Saving every value separately is a lot more work.

item01=title_priority_duedate_state_arrayLocation

I still need to implement priority and due date. And possibly points.
Priority and due date are already in the item object, but still need to get visual components.
Points will have to be made from scratch, because there's nothing about them yet.

TODO: Implement priority and duedate

ISSUE: "document" often does not work anymore
