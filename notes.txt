Could add points for when you complete task.
Then there should be separate remove buttons too.

Items will probably need some sort of code to store their values.
Saving every value separately is a lot more work.

item01=title_priority_duedate_state_arrayLocation

I still need to implement priority and due date. And possibly points.
Priority and due date are already in the item object, but still need to get visual components.
Points will have to be made from scratch, because there's nothing about them yet.

TODO: Implement and duedate
TODO: Add a favicon

Right now, the controls are not very clear. You can't know that adding ! to the end can give you a priority.
I need to change that somehow, without making it too unclear.
