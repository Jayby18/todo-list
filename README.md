# todo-list
A simple to-do list created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I decided that I needed to program more to get better and I came up with this idea.
I'm currently still working on it. But it's close to complete.

Every item can have a title, a priority, a state, an element and an location in the index array.
I'm currently working on implementing due dates.

Right now you can give items a priority by adding !1, !2 or !3 to the end.
!1 will be red.
!2 will be orange.
!3 will be yellow.
